Hi Ajay,
 
Below are few of the topics and Questions which I can recollect:
Active Passive Failover routing with Latency based failover
3-4 Questions were based on NAT gateway, but based on different scenarios and twisted little bit.
Scenario based question for Type of Disk (General purpose, cold Hdd, Throughput or provisioned IOPs)
Cloud front with OAI
One question on CloudFront Geolocation
2 Questions on ECS (You need to deploy the applications into microservices and Containers)
2 questions were based on Amazon EFS
Application Load balancer: Your application is using application load balancer. You need to allow only that traffic which are allowed by Application load balancer.  (Use the application LB Security group for the EC2)
Basic questions on S3 for versioning and Life cycle policy
Cloud front Signed urls
Couple of questions on IAM roles
Amazon Redshift: Dataware house and able to do queries: So, I chose Redshift
Application is capturing the real-time geographical data and you need to store this in dataware house. Choose two services (I chose AWS Kinesis Firehose and Redshift)
Fault tolerant and cost-efficient scenario: 3 AZs minimum 4 available (I chose 2 EC2 in each availability zone)
 





Below are the mentioned topics which appeared in my exam:
 
·         5 question were from NAT gateway & NAT instance. Choosing among them based upon cost.
·         One was of active passive failover routing policy.
·         3 question were from IAM policy.
·         Scenario based question for Type of Disk (General purpose, cold Hdd, Throughput or provisioned IOPs)
·         You are a solution arch of a company and you experience a heavy traffic from a specific Ip. How can u stop that Ip from accessing your n/w.  Answer applying NACL.
·         Application is capturing the real-time geographical data and you need to store this in data ware house. Choose two services (I chose AWS Kinesis Fire hose and Redshift)
·         Fault tolerant and cost-efficient scenario: 3 AZs minimum 4 available (I chose 2 EC2 in each availability zone)
·         Complex scenario based on backing up of data in disaster recovery.
·         S3 versioning & implementing lifecycle policy.
·         2 question were from ECS.
·         Encryption of EBS volume & Copying that encrypted volume to S3 during disaster recovery.
 
 
 
Thanks
Utkarsh.

I was unsuccessful to clear the AWS – SA exam. I need to work on my understanding towards each services in depth.
 
Please find the below questions which I can recollect while giving the exam. I believe we have received the same set @Anil and Utkarsh please suggest.
·         You are a solution arch of a company and you experience a heavy traffic from a specific IP. How can u stop that IP from accessing your n/w.  Answer applying NACL to deny specific IP’s
·         One question on failover with respect to low latency using Route53 – Answer active passive failover using latency policy.
·         Fault tolerant and cost-efficient scenario: 2 AZs with minimum 4 available Ec2 instance  (I chose 4 EC2 in each availability zone)
·         3 question were from ECS. – Micro services deployment –  ECS Orchestration – Docker images
·         Application is capturing the real-time geographical data and you need to store this in data ware house. Choose two services (I chose AWS Kinesis Fire hose and Redshift)
·         DynamoDB – offload the administration burden. Received around 8 Questions where DynamoDB was in option and looked feasible as a solution.
·         Scenario based question for Type of Disk (General purpose, cold Hdd, Throughput or provisioned IOPs) from a large volume of Dataware house the data is required to store in EBS volume which one to choose.
·         On-prem is facing some challenges in message broker and MQTT and they want to go with Cloud which option will help them to migrate to AWS ( option - SQS, SNS, AWS MQ, AWS SWF) – I selected SQS
·         Data needs to be stored in large volume and needs to run with aggregation and visualization Choose 2 ( Redshift , Lambda, Kineses, DynamoDB , SQS) I choose Redshifts and Lambda
·         Two option has API gateway with Lambda which I choose for server less architecture with Managed AWS service.
·         Application is expecting a high peaks on Monday through Friday and on Saturday it needs to run batch processes – choose (Spot, on – demand – reserved – IA or reserved storage) I choose Spot
·         Auto scaling default termination policy ( oldest launch configuration, closest to next billing hour, Old instance, randomly terminate) choose 1 – I selected with oldest launch configuration
·         There is a requirement to store data in S3 and after a month the data it not accessed but it should be able to achieve data whenever required – I chose AWS lifecycle policy to store data in Glacier after one month.
·         Application load balancer needs to restrict traffic – use Public IPS for ALB node, use security group of deny traffic to load balancer, use private IPs to restrict traffic on ALB ) I choose first option
·         There was one question for SAAS product user wants to leverage all the features and the user wants to go with server less architecture  – (options : API gateway using Lambda, Cloudformation using Lambda, API gateway with DynamoBD) I choose first option   
·         VPC – when to use Nat Gateway or Nat instance for private subnet to frequently communicate with internet – I choose Nat Gateway
·         There is one question for fault tolerant solution which needs to span across 200 Miles for disaster recovery for RDS– Enable cross region replication , Enable multi - az deployment , cross region snapshot – I choose Enable cross region replication
·         Also, there was one question on amazon RDS Aurora DB – I cannot recollect the actual content of the questions and the options as answers.
 
Hardly there were 6 to 7 questions which could be answered easily. Considering Whiz Labs training for sample questions for each AWS services, I can conclude the difficulty level of each questions compared to WhizLabs  has really increased.
